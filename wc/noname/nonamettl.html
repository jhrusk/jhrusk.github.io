<P><HR><P><H3>Note: With Wilkie Collins' blessing, William Bayle Bernard (1807-1875) adapted the novel <I>No Name</I> for the stage in 1863. It was never performed in England, although a limited number of copies were published to secure copyright.

<P>I am indebted to Paul Lewis for access to the version published in New York by De Witt's Acting Plays, which is the source for this electronic version.</CENTER>
