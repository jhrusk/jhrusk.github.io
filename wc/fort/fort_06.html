<P>HE paused; his head sank on his breast; his story was told.

<P>I have repeated his words as nearly as I can remember them; but I can give no idea of the modest and touching resignation with which he spoke. To say that I pitied him with my whole heart, is to say nothing. I loved him with my whole heart--and I may acknowledge it now!

<P>"Oh, Mr. Cameron," I said, as soon as I could trust myself to speak, "can nothing be done to help you? Is there no hope?"

<P>"There is always hope," he answered, without raising his head. "I have to thank <I>you</I>, Miss Brading, for teaching me that."

<P>"To thank me?" I repeated. "How have I taught you to hope?"

<P>"You have brightened my dreary life. When I am with you, all my bitter remembrances leave me. I am a happy man again; and a happy man can always hope. I dream now of finding what I have never yet had--a dear and devoted friend, who will rouse the energy that has sunk in me under the martyrdom that I have endured. Why do I submit to the loss of my rights and my liberty, without an effort to recover them? I was alone in the world until I met with you. I had no kind hand to raise me, no kind voice to encourage me. Shall I ever find the hand? Shall I ever hear the voice? When I am with you, the hope that you have taught me answers Yes. When I am by myself, the old despair comes back, and says No."

<P>He lifted his head for the first time. If I had not understood what his words meant, his look would have enlightened me. The tears came into my eyes; my heart heaved and fluttered wildly; my hands mechanically tore up and scattered the grass round me. The silence became unendurable. I spoke, hardly knowing what I was saying; tearing faster and faster at the poor harmless grass, as if my whole business in life was to pull up the greatest quantity in the shortest possible space of time!

<P>"We have only known each other a little while," I said; "and a woman is but a weak ally in such a terrible position as yours. But useless as I may be, count on me, now and always, as your friend--"

<P>He moved close to me before I could say more, and took my hand. He murmured in my ear,

<P>"May I count on you one day as the nearest and dearest friend of all? Will you forgive me, Mary, if I own that I love you? You have taught me to love, as you have taught me to hope. It is in your power to lighten my hard lot. <I>You</I> can recompense me for all that I have suffered; <I>you</I> can rouse me to struggle for my freedom and my rights. Be the good angel of my life! Forgive me, love me, rescue me--be my wife!"

<P>I don't know how it happened. I found myself in his arms--and I answered him in a kiss. Taking all the circumstances into consideration, I dare say I was guilty, in accepting him, of the rashest act that ever a woman committed. Very good. I didn't care then--I don't care now. I was then, and I am now, the happiest woman living.
